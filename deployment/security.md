## Security Architecture Overview

The system implements a defense-in-depth approach with multiple security layers:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph External
        Client[Client Application]
        API[API Gateway]
    end
    
    subgraph Security_Layers
        WAF[Web Application Firewall]
        AuthN[Authentication Layer]
        AuthZ[Authorization Layer]
        Encrypt[Encryption Layer]
    end
    
    subgraph Internal
        Services[Microservices]
        Data[Data Storage]
    end
    
    Client --> WAF
    WAF --> API
    API --> AuthN
    AuthN --> AuthZ
    AuthZ --> Encrypt
    Encrypt --> Services
    Services --> Data
```

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant AG as API Gateway
    participant AS as Auth Service
    participant KM as Key Management
    
    C->>AG: Request Access
    AG->>AS: Validate Credentials
    AS->>KM: Get User Keys
    KM-->>AS: Return Keys
    AS-->>AG: Auth Token + Keys
    AG-->>C: Session Established
```

### Authorization Levels

- **User Roles**:
    - Admin: Full system access
    - Manager: Service management access
    - User: Basic service access
    - Guest: Read-only access

- **Permission Matrix**:
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        subgraph Permissions
            Read[Read Operations]
            Write[Write Operations]
            Delete[Delete Operations]
            Admin[Admin Operations]
        end
        
        Guest --> Read
        User --> Read
        User --> Write
        Manager --> Read
        Manager --> Write
        Manager --> Delete
        Admin --> Read
        Admin --> Write
        Admin --> Delete
        Admin --> Admin
    ```

## Encryption Protocols

### Data at Rest

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Encryption_Layers
        L1[File Level - AES-256-GCM]
        L2[Database Level - TDE]
        L3[Disk Level - Hardware Encryption]
    end
    
    Raw[Raw Data] --> L1
    L1 --> L2
    L2 --> L3
    L3 --> Stored[Encrypted Storage]
```

### Data in Transit

- TLS 1.3 for all external communications
- mTLS for service-to-service communication
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) enabled

### Encryption Specifications
- AES-256-GCM for file encryption
- RSA-4096 for key exchange
- SHA-512 for hashing
- Argon2id for password hashing

## Key Management

### Key Hierarchy

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Key_Hierarchy
        MK[Master Key]
        DEK[Data Encryption Keys]
        KEK[Key Encryption Keys]
        SK[Session Keys]
    end
    
    MK --> KEK
    KEK --> DEK
    DEK --> SK
```

### Key Rotation Policy
- Master Keys: Annual rotation
- Data Encryption Keys: Quarterly rotation
- Session Keys: Daily rotation
- Immediate rotation on compromise

## Network Security

### Network Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph DMZ
        LB[Load Balancer]
        WAF[Web Application Firewall]
    end
    
    subgraph Private_Subnet
        API[API Services]
        App[Application Services]
    end
    
    subgraph Database_Subnet
        DB[Databases]
        Cache[Cache Servers]
    end
    
    Internet --> DMZ
    DMZ --> Private_Subnet
    Private_Subnet --> Database_Subnet
```

### Security Controls
- IP whitelisting
- Rate limiting
- DDoS protection
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Network segmentation
- Regular security scans

## Security Best Practices

### Coding Standards
- Input validation
- Output encoding
- Parameterized queries
- Secure logging practices
- Error handling

### Access Control
- Principle of least privilege
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Session management
- Regular access reviews

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### Security Monitoring

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Detection
        Logs[Log Collection]
        SIEM[SIEM System]
        IDS[Intrusion Detection]
    end
    
    subgraph Response
        Alert[Alert Generation]
        Analysis[Threat Analysis]
        Action[Response Action]
    end
    
    Logs --> SIEM
    IDS --> SIEM
    SIEM --> Alert
    Alert --> Analysis
    Analysis --> Action
```

### Incident Response Plan
1. Detection and Analysis
2. Containment
3. Eradication
4. Recovery
5. Post-Incident Analysis

### Security Metrics
- Mean time to detect (MTTD)
- Mean time to respond (MTTR)
- Security incident rate
- Vulnerability remediation time
- Security training completion rate
