## System Interactions and Workflows

### 1. File Upload Workflow
```
Client -> API Gateway -> Auth Service -> File Processor
    -> [Chunk Processing] -> Graph Service
    -> [Async Processing] -> Worker Service
```

### 2. Graph Query Workflow
```
Client -> API Gateway -> Auth Service -> Graph Service
    -> [Query Processing] -> [Results]
    -> [Optional: Vector Service for embeddings]
```

## Future Considerations
